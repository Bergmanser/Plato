# Cypress E2E Test Plan

## Objective
Ensure the reliability of user authentication processes, validate the accuracy of data management functionalities, and verify the overall user experience and system performance.

## Scope
This test plan covers:
- User authentication for Parent, Employee, and Student roles.
- Password reset functionality.
- UI interactions and error handling.

## Test Scenarios

### Parent Login
- **Load Login Page**: Verify the login page loads correctly.
- **Successful Login**: Test login with valid credentials.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Test login with valid credentials but incorrect role.
- **Invalid Login**: Test login with invalid credentials.
- **Password Reset**: Test password reset functionality.

### Employee Login
- **Load Login Page**: Verify the login page loads correctly.
- **Successful Login**: Test login with valid credentials.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Test login with valid credentials but incorrect role.
- **Invalid Login**: Test login with invalid credentials.
- **Password Reset**: Test password reset functionality.

### Student Login
- **Load Login Page**: Verify the login page loads correctly.
- **Successful Login**: Test login with valid credentials.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Test login with valid credentials but incorrect role.
- **Invalid Login**: Test login with invalid credentials.

## Configuration
- **Video Recording**: Enabled
- **Screenshots on Failure**: Enabled

## Firebase Mocks
- **Authentication**: Mocked authentication service to simulate login and password reset.
- **Firestore**: Mocked Firestore service to simulate data retrieval and updates.
- **Storage**: Mocked storage service if applicable.

## Test Environment
- **Base URL**: http://127.0.0.1:5500
- **Browsers**: Chrome (default), can be configured to use others as needed.
- **Operating System**: macOS, Windows, or Linux as applicable.

## Risk Management
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure test data is anonymized and complies with data protection regulations.
- **Test Data Management**: Regularly update and maintain test data to reflect current project requirements.
- **Resource Management**: Prioritize critical test cases and functionalities to manage limited resources effectively.
- **Requirement Changes**: Establish a change management process to handle updates in project requirements.

## Commands and Customizations
- **Custom Commands**: Describe any custom Cypress commands used in the tests.
  - `cy.login(email, password, role)`: Custom command to log in a user with specific credentials and role.
  - `cy.mockFirebase()`: Custom command to mock Firebase services.

## Conclusion
This document serves as the comprehensive test plan for the Cypress E2E tests, ensuring all relevant functionalities are covered, tested, and documented to maintain the quality and reliability of the web application.
